## Introduction

We encourage contributions to this guide. The goal of the guide on cloud-optimized geospatial formats is to provide documentation on the best practices for the current state of the art cloud-optimized formats. These formats are evolving, and so will the guide.

## Pre-requisites

If you wish to preview the site locally, install [quarto](https://quarto.org/). You will also need to be familiar with [quarto markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).

## Communication Channels

Discussions can take place in GitHub Discussions: [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/developmentseed/cloud-optimized-geospatial-formats-guide/discussions) and issues can be raised at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/developmentseed/cloud-optimized-geospatial-formats-guide/issues).

## Core Principles

1. This guide is intended to be opinionated, but acknowledges there is no one-size-fits-all solution.
2. This guide should provide the best information and guidance available, but acknowledge there are many existing resources out there developed by experts. Those resources should be linked as appropriate.

## Additional Criteria

* All examples should use open data. If an example uses Earthdata, it must include an example of how to provide credentials ([Earthdata registration](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new) is open to anyone).
* Landing pages with no code should use [quarto markdown (`.qmd`)](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).
* Pages with executable code should be [iPython Notebooks (`.ipynb`)](https://ipython.org/notebook.html).

## Code of Conduct

* Be inclusive, respectful and understanding of others' backgrounds and contexts.
* Look for and foster diverse perspectives.
* If you experience any harmful behavior, please contact aimee@developmentseed.org or alex@developmentseed.org.

## How to Contribute

### General Steps

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Create a new branch for your changes.
4. Make your changes and use `quarto preview` to make sure they look good.
5. Open a pull request.

Once the pull request is opened, and the GitHub `preview.yml` workflow runs ("Deploy PR previews"), you should have a preview available for review at `https://developmentseed.org/cloud-optimized-geospatial-formats-guide/pr-preview/pr-<YOUR-PR-NUMBER-HERE>`.

### Specific Contributions

#### 1. Adding a New Format

Follow the steps outlined in the General Steps, then:

1. Create a folder with the format's name and, within that folder, an `intro.qmd`.
2. Link to the `intro.qmd` page in the `index.qmd` (the **Welcome** page) file and `_quarto.yml` table of contents.

#### 2. Modify or Add to an Existing Format

Feel free to modify or add to existing content if you think it could be improved.

#### 3. Adding a Cookbook

Cookbooks should address common questions and present solutions for cloud-optimized access and visualization. To create a cookbook, either add a notebook directly to this repository in the cookbooks directory OR use an external link and add it to cookbooks/index.qmd.

#### 4. (Optional) Update Slides

If you have made substantive changes, consider updating the [Overview Slides](./overview.qmd). These slides are generated using [Quarto and Reveal.js](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) so can be updated with markdown syntax.

#### 5. Add Yourself to the List of Authors

Add yourself to the list of authors on the [Welcome](./index.qmd#authors) page.

#### 6. Final Steps Before Merging

Once your PR is approved and all checks have passed, a project maintainer will merge your changes into the main repository.
