We encourage contributions to this guide.

## Pre-requisites

If you wish to preview the site locally, install [quarto](https://quarto.org/). You will also need to be familiar with [quarto markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).

## Core principles

1. This guide is intended to be opinionated, but acknowledges there is no one-size-fits all solution.
2. This guide should provide best information and guidance available, but acknowledge there are many existing resources out there developed by experts. Those resources should be linked as appropriate.

## Additional criteria

* All examples should use open data. If an example uses Earthdata, it must include an example of how to provide credentials ([Earthdata registration](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new) is open to anyone).
* Landing pages with no code should be use [quarto markdown (`.qmd`)](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).
* Pages with executable code should be [iPython Notebooks (`.ipynb`)](https://ipython.org/notebook.html)

## Code of Conduct

* Be inclusive, respectful and understanding of others' backgrounds and contexts.
* Look for and foster diverse perspectives.
* If you experience any harmful behavior, please contact aimee@developmentseed.org or alex@developmentseed.org.

## How to contribute

### 0. General

Fork the repository, make changes, use `quarto preview` to make sure the changes look good and open a pull request.

Once the pull request is opened, and the github `preview.yml` workflow runs ("Deploy PR previews"), you should have a preview available for review at https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/pr-preview/pr-<YOUR-PR-NUMBER-HERE>.

### 1. Adding a new format

1. Create a folder with the formats name and, within that folder, an `intro.qmd`. The `intro.qmd` file should describe the basics about that format.
2. Link to the `intro.qmd` page in the `index.qmd` (the **Welcome** page) file and `_quarto.yml` table of contents.
3. Optionally, add a notebook with examples of creating and accessing (via the cloud) a file of that format. We suggest including an [`environment.yml` file](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-file-manually) that defines the Conda packages necessary for the given notebook.

### 2. Modify or add to an existing format

Feel free to modify or add to existing content if you think it could be improved.

### 3. Adding a cookbook

Cookbooks should address common questions and present solutions for cloud-optimized access and visualization. For example:

* How do I chose the chunk shape for my Zarr?
* How do I determine and preview the resampling algorithm for my COG overview?
* How do I create STAC metadata for my cloud-optimized data?
* How do I provide visualizations fo this data?
* How do I provide subsetted/query/analytical access this data?

To create a cookbook, either add a notebook directly to this repository in the cookbooks directory OR use an external link and add it to cookbooks/index.qmd.

### 4. (Optional) Update slides

If you have made substantive changes, consider if the [Overview Slides](./overview.qmd) should be updated. These slides are generated using [Quarto and Reveal.js](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) so can be updated with markdown syntax.

### 5. Add yourself to the list of authors on the [Welcome](./index.qmd#authors) page!

### 6. Once your PR is approved, merge away.
