## Introduction

We encourage contributions to this guide. The guide's goal on cloud-optimized geospatial formats is to provide documentation on the best practices for the current state-of-the-art cloud-optimized formats. These formats are evolving, and so will the guide.

## Pre-requisites

If you wish to preview the site locally, install quarto. You will also need to be familiar with quarto markdown.

## Communication Channels

Discussions can occur in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/developmentseed/cloud-optimized-geospatial-formats-guide/discussions) and issues can be raised at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/developmentseed/cloud-optimized-geospatial-formats-guide/issues).

## Core Principles

1. This guide intends to be opinionated but acknowledges no one-size-fits-all solution.
2. This guide should provide the best information and guidance available but acknowledge that experts develop many existing resources. Those resources should be linked as appropriate.

## Additional Criteria

- All examples should use open data. If an example uses Earthdata, it must include an example of providing credentials ([Earthdata registration](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new) is available to anyone).
- Landing pages with no code should use [quarto markdown (`.qmd`)](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).
- Pages with executable code should be [iPython Notebooks (`.ipynb`)](https://ipython.org/notebook.html).

## Code of Conduct

- Be inclusive, respectful, and understanding of others' backgrounds and contexts.
- Look for and foster diverse perspectives.
- If you experience any harmful behavior, please get in touch with [Aimee](mailto:aimee@developmentseed.org) or [Alex](mailto:alex@developmentseed.org).

## Bug Reporting

## Feature Requests

For feature requests, please submit an issue on the GitHub repository.

## How to Contribute

### General Steps

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Create a new branch for your changes.
4. Make your changes and use `quarto preview` to make sure they look good.
5. Open a pull request.

Once the pull request is opened, and the GitHub `preview.yml` workflow runs ("Deploy PR previews"), you should have a preview available for review at `https://developmentseed.org/cloud-optimized-geospatial-formats-guide/pr-preview/pr-<YOUR-PR-NUMBER-HERE>`.

### Specific Contributions

#### 1. Adding a New Format

Follow the steps outlined in the General Steps, then:

1. Create a folder with the format's name and, within that folder, an `intro.qmd`.
2. Link to the `intro.qmd` page in the `index.qmd` (the **Welcome** page) file and `_quarto.yml` table of contents.

#### 2. Modify or Add to an Existing Format

Feel free to modify or add to existing content if you think it could be improved.

#### 3. Adding a Cookbook

Cookbooks should address common questions and present solutions for cloud-optimized access and visualization. To create a cookbook, either add a notebook directly to this repository in the cookbooks directory OR use an external link and add it to cookbooks/index.qmd.

#### 4. (Optional) Update Slides

If you have made substantive changes, consider updating the [Overview Slides](./overview.qmd). These slides are generated using [Quarto and Reveal.js](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) so can be updated with markdown syntax.

#### 5. Add Yourself to the List of Authors

Add yourself to the list of authors on the [Welcome](./index.qmd#authors) page.

#### 6. Final Steps Before Merging

Once your PR is approved and all checks have passed, a project maintainer will merge your changes into the main repository.
