- Columnar format
- Full type system that can support even nested types

The Parquet format supports a wide variety of data types for attributes, even including _nested_ types. This means that you can store a key-value mapping or a multi-dimensional array _within an attribute column_ of a GeoParquet dataset.

## Multiple-file datasets

GeoParquet is most often distributed as a single file, but the Parquet format allows for

Some reasons why you might want to use a multiple file dataset are:

- Writing from a distributed program
- Spatial partitioning (this is not yet defined by the GeoParquet specification)
-
