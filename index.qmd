# Who this guide is for

If you wish to provide optimized access to geospatial data, this guide is for you. Given the large and growing size of geospatial data, users can no longer rely solely on file download to achieve their science goals.

## Built for the community, by the community.

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to cloud-optimized data, but the community has developed many tools for creating and assessing geospatial formats that should be organized and shared.

With this guide, we provide the landscape of cloud-optimized geospatial formats and provide the best-known answers to common questions.

## The Opportunity

Just putting data on the cloud does not solve the big geospatial data problem. Massive archives of data must be available via subsetting services in order for users to work with the data in-memory. Traditional geospatial formats are optimized for on-disk access via small internal chunks. The introduction of a network introduces  latency and the number of requests must considered. The file format must support subsetted access via adressable chunks, internal tiling or both. These characteristics allow for parallelized and partial reading.

## Data Type to Traditional to Cloud-Optimized Geospatial File Format Table

The diagram below depicts how some of the cloud-optimized formats discussed in this guide are cloud-optimized formats of traditional geospatial file formats.

Notes:
* Some data formats cover multiple data types, specifically:
    * GeoJSON can be used for both vector and point data.
    * HDF5 can be used for point data or data cubes (or both via groups).
    * GeoParquet and FlatGeobuf can be used for vector data or point data.
* LAS files are intended for 3D points, not 2D points (since COPC files are compressed LAS files, same goes for COPC files).
* [TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/topojson) (an extension of GeoJSON that encodes topology) and [newline-delimited GeoJSON](https://stevage.github.io/ndgeojson/) are types of GeoJSON worth mentioning but not explicitly represented in the diagram.
* GeoTIFF, FlatGeobuf, and GeoParquet are geospatial versions of the non-geospatial file formats TIFF, binary and parquet, respectively.

## Questions to ask when generating cloud-optimized geospatial data in any format

1. What variable(s) should be included in the new data foramt
2. Will you create copies to optimize for different needs?
3. What is the intended use case or usage profile? Will this product be used for visualization, analysis or both?
4. What is the expected access method?
5. How much of your data is typically rendered or selected at once? All to very select subsets?
