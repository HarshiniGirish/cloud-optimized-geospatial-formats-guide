# Advanced COG Details

In the [COG Intro](intro.qmd) you can see what makes a COG different from non-optimized GeoTIFFs. The rest of this page details additional GeoTIFF information that can be relevant to making your files as useful as possible but not a COG requirement.

## Data Type

**Recommendation** The smallest possible data type that still represents the data appropriately should be used. It is not generally recommended to shift or quantize data from float to integer by multiplying, a space saving technique, as end users then need to undo this step to use the data. Data compression is preferred, see also [Compression](#compression).

The GeoTIFF format supports many data types. The key is that all bands must be of the same data type. Unlike some other formats, you cannot mix and match integer (whole number) and float (decimal number) data types in the same file. If you have this use case consider splitting files by data type and using a catalog like STAC to keep track of them, or look at other formats like [Zarr](../zarr/intro.qmd).

Scenario: If the COG is intended only for visualization, conversion to 3 band byte will improve performance.

## Compression (aka File Size)

The biggest benefit to compression is on the storage side. It’s always recommended to use a lossless compression method unless the COG is intended to be used only for visualization. **Deflate** or **LZW** are the recommended compression algorithms for general use. **LERC** (Limited Error Raster Compression) provides very efficient data compression for float data if you're ok rounding to some precision you provide. (This could be useful, e.g. for elevation data where the source data is known to not have precision beyond a known value.) Some other compression algorithms may be preferred depending on the data type and distribution, and if the goal is maximum compression or not. Maximum compression does result in some performance loss.

## No Data

Setting a no data value makes it clear to users and visualization tools what pixels are not actually data. For visualization this allows these pixels to be easily hidden (transparent). Historically many values have been used, 0, -9999, etc… The key is to make sure the GDAL flag for no data is set. It is also suggested that the smallest negative value be used instead of a random value. For byte and unsigned integers data types this will be 0. For float data, setting NaN as the no data value is suggested. Make sure to use a no data value that does not have meaning in your data; otherwise use a different value (like the max possible value). Having the right nodata flag set is important for overview generation.

## Projection

Read performance can be greatly impacted by the choice of projection and the particular applications used for dynamic tile serving. Using a known CRS defined in the PROJ database (typically EPSG code) is preferred over custom projections. Load times can be 5-20 times greater when using a custom projection. Whenever applying projections make sure to use WKT2 representation. If using a database of known projections, i.e. EPSG codes, this should be fine, there are known issues around manually setting proj-strings.

## What we don’t know (areas of research)

* The optimum size of data at which splitting across files improves performance as a multi-file dataset instead of a single file.
* When to recommend particular internal tile sizes
* Compression impacts on http transfer rates.
* Support for COG creation in all common geospatial tools varies.
