The LAS(er) file format is designed to store 3-dimension point cloud data typically collected from [LiDAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar).
A COPC file is a valid LAZ file. An LAZ file is a compressed LAS file. The LAS file format stores 3-dimension (x,y,z) point cloud data, typically collected from LiDAR.
