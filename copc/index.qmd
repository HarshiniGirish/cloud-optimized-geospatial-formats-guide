The LAS(er) file format is designed to store 3-dimension point cloud data typically collected from [LiDAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar).

A COPC file is a valid LAZ file. An LAZ file is a compressed LAS file. The LAS file format stores 3-dimension (x,y,z) point cloud data, typically collected from LiDAR. COPC files are similar to COGs for GeoTIFFs: Both are valid versions of the original file format but with additional requirements to support cloud-optimized data access. In the case of COGs, there are additional requirements for tiling and overviews. For COPC, data must be organized into a clustered octree with a variable-length record (VLR) describing the octree structure.
